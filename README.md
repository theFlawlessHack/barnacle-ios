# Barnacle

<b>Bonjour</b> Barnacle.<br>
Barnacle allows users to explore their area the way a computer sees. Users take pictures of things in their area which are immediately interpreted and spoken out loud by their device.<br><br>
Barnacle was created as a way to explore accessibility and machine learning. How can machine learning be an assistive technology?  

## what is machine learning

Machine Learning is giving a computer the ability to think and learn without being explicitly programming.

## installation

#### Familiar with repo cloning and xcode?
Feel free to pull and run the project.<br>
The project must be run on a physical iOS device. Make sure your sound is turned on to take advantage of the spoken aspect of the app.

#### Not tech savy? That's OK
You can submit your email to this form and you will be added to a testing list. Further instructions on how to get the app on your device will be emailed..
